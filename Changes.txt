Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Explorer.

1.10  Sat Mar 11 14:00:00 2001
	- Change
		use CGI qw/fieldset legend/;
		to
		use CGI;
		in Explorer.pm. These methods are only used by ce.pl.
	- Add method image($icon_id, $new_image) to allow setting the image file name
		of any icon. See POD for a list of icon ids.
	- Add constructor option css to set the style-sheet for submit buttons.
		A default style-sheet is provided. Yes, I know the submit button text,
		using the style-sheet, is really too wide, but as you'll see from the source,
		I cannot find a style-sheet command to make it narrower.
	- Add method css() to set or retrieve the style-sheet. As with other new() options,
		you can also use method set(css => $new_css) to set the style-sheet after
		construction.
	- Rename constructor option from 'a_href' to 'click_text', since I now use
		submit buttons and not a hrefs. The default for click_text is 1,
		whereas for a_href it was 0.
		Specifically, new(click_text => 1) has the effect of making the text
		(node id and/or name) [to the right of the node] into a submit button,
		formatted nicely via the css option. Clicking this text submits the form
		and sets the current node. But, if the node has children, it does not change
		the open/closed status of the node, whereas clicking on the node icon toggles
		the status.
	- Remove restriction that there had to be a node id == 1.
	- Ship explorer_server.gif and explorer_server.png for variety, and for use
		within ce.pl.
	- Various minor changes to the docs.
