Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Explorer.

1.13  Sun May 12 13:12:11 2002
	- Clean up licence and email stuff in all modules, scripts and other docs.
		Upgrading is not necessary

1.12  Sat Mar 24 17:15:00 2001
	- Add constructor option css_background. It is used to set the background color
		of submit buttons.
	- Add constructor option css_color. It is used to set the foreground color of
		submit buttons.
	- Add method depth($id), which returns the depth of the node with the given id, or 0.
	- Add method get($option), which returns the value of the given option, or undef.
		Eg: $tree -> get('sort_by') returns 'name', by default.
	- Enhance ce.pl to demonstrate these options.

1.11  Wed Mar 14 21:00:00 2001
	- Add constructor option sort_by. When set to 'name' (the default), the nodes
		are sorted by name. When set to 'id', the nodes are sorted by id.
		Patch ce.pl to demonstrate this, by making it now sort by id.
	- Add code to ce.pl to set all even ids to open the very first time the script
		is run. This is simply to demonstrate how to pre-set the open/closed status
		of nodes.
	- Reformat part of the pod to avoid a bug in pod2hml. See note under method
		B<image()>.
	- Fix spelling of horizontal.

1.10  Sat Mar 11 14:00:00 2001
	- Change
		use CGI qw/fieldset legend/;
		to
		use CGI;
		in Explorer.pm. These methods are only used by ce.pl.
	- Add method image($icon_id, $new_image) to allow setting the image file name
		of any icon. See POD for a list of icon ids.
	- Add constructor option css to set the style-sheet for submit buttons.
		A default style-sheet is provided. Yes, I know the submit button text,
		using the style-sheet, is really too wide, but as you'll see from the source,
		I cannot find a style-sheet command to make it narrower.
	- Add method css() to set or retrieve the style-sheet. As with other new() options,
		you can also use method set(css => $new_css) to set the style-sheet after
		construction.
	- Rename constructor option from 'a_href' to 'click_text', since I now use
		submit buttons and not a hrefs. The default for click_text is 1,
		whereas for a_href it was 0.
		Specifically, new(click_text => 1) has the effect of making the text
		(node id and/or name) [to the right of the node] into a submit button,
		formatted nicely via the css option. Clicking this text submits the form
		and sets the current node. But, if the node has children, it does not change
		the open/closed status of the node, whereas clicking on the node icon toggles
		the status.
	- Remove restriction that there had to be a node id == 1.
	- Ship explorer_server.gif and explorer_server.png for variety, and for use
		within ce.pl.
	- Various minor changes to the docs.
