[V 2.05]

[V 2.02]
Date=2003-11-06T13:24:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Upgrade xTree from V 1.15 to V 1.17. The latter version supports targets (frames).
- Change the path to the images used by xTree from /images/ to /images/explorer/.
- Add an option called 'target' to new(). This allows you to specify the name of a
frame which is to receive the output of the CGI script which is using this module.
The POD contains a long explanation of this option.

[V 2.01]
Date=2003-10-05T11:12:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Properly document the hash keys _open_icon and _shut_icon.
Thanx to Peter <boca@freemail.hu> for drawing this to my attention.
EOT

[V 2.00]
Date=2002-12-10T20:05:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Note: The API for V 2 has nothing in common with the API for V 1
- Rewrite to use xtree by Emil A Eklund http://webfx.eae.net/
This means mouse clicks which expand and contract sub-trees
are handled by JavaScript in the client and so do not need
to send a message on a round trip to the server and back
- Ship Eklund's files xtree.css and xtree.js
- Use Eklund's files for the images too and 3 extra images (see POD)
- Ship a demo hobbit-hash.cgi which displays a hash tree.
This script does not require any other modules
- Ship a demo pair bootstrap-hobbit.pl which creates a database table and
hobbit.cgi which reads and displays a database table as a hash tree.
These 2 scripts require DBIx::Hash2Table and DBIx::Table2Hash
- Document how to use hobbit.cgi as an Apache V 2 script
- Add a trivial test script t/test.t which is actually a copy of test.pl
- Rewrite the documentation

[V 1.14]
Date=2002-10-26T14:29:00
Comments=- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

[V 1.13]
Date=2002-05-12T13:12:11
Comments= <<EOT
- Clean up licence and email stuff in all modules scripts and other docs.
Upgrading is not necessary
EOT

[V 1.12]
Date=2001-03-24T17:15:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add constructor option css_background. It is used to set the background color
of submit buttons.
- Add constructor option css_color. It is used to set the foreground color of
submit buttons.
- Add method depth($id) which returns the depth of the node with the given id or 0.
- Add method get($option) which returns the value of the given option or undef.
Eg: $tree -> get('sort_by') returns 'name' by default.
- Enhance ce.pl to demonstrate these options.
EOT

[V 1.11]
Date=2001-03-14T21:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add constructor option sort_by. When set to 'name' (the default) the nodes
are sorted by name. When set to 'id' the nodes are sorted by id.
Patch ce.pl to demonstrate this by making it now sort by id.
- Add code to ce.pl to set all even ids to open the very first time the script
is run. This is simply to demonstrate how to pre-set the open/closed status
of nodes.
- Reformat part of the pod to avoid a bug in pod2hml. See note under method
B<image()>.
- Fix spelling of horizontal.
EOT

[V 1.10]
Date=2001-03-11T14:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Change
use CGI qw/fieldset legend/;
to
use CGI;
in Explorer.pm. These methods are only used by ce.pl.
- Add method image($icon_id $new_image) to allow setting the image file name
of any icon. See POD for a list of icon ids.
- Add constructor option css to set the style-sheet for submit buttons.
A default style-sheet is provided. Yes I know the submit button text
using the style-sheet is really too wide but as you'll see from the source
I cannot find a style-sheet command to make it narrower.
- Add method css() to set or retrieve the style-sheet. As with other new() options
you can also use method set(css => $new_css) to set the style-sheet after
construction.
- Rename constructor option from 'a_href' to 'click_text' since I now use
submit buttons and not a hrefs. The default for click_text is 1
whereas for a_href it was 0.
Specifically new(click_text => 1) has the effect of making the text
(node id and/or name) [to the right of the node] into a submit button
formatted nicely via the css option. Clicking this text submits the form
and sets the current node. But if the node has children it does not change
the open/closed status of the node whereas clicking on the node icon toggles
the status.
- Remove restriction that there had to be a node id == 1.
- Ship explorer_server.gif and explorer_server.png for variety and for use
within ce.pl.
- Various minor changes to the docs.
